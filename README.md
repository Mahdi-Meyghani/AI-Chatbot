# AI Chatbot Application

## Overview
The AI Chatbot is a sophisticated application designed to facilitate natural and meaningful conversations between humans and an AI. Built entirely using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python, this chatbot leverages the power of the OpenAI API to generate responses to user inputs. The application features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created using the PyQt6 library, ensuring a user-friendly and interactive experience.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Conversations**: Engage in natural language conversations with the AI, capable of discussing a wide range of topics.
- **Versatile Functionality**: Use the chatbot for various purposes such as writing stories, planning ideas, messaging, and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The GUI is designed with PyQt6 to provide an intuitive and seamless user experience.
- **Text-Based Interaction**: Communicate with the chatbot through simple text messages.
